# CHAPTER_2
#Creating a Hello World App

In this chapter, I learned how to create my first app and use hot reload to view changes instantaneously. I also learned how to use themes to style apps, when to use stateless and stateful widgets, and how to add external packages to save yourself from reinventing the wheel. Now I have a general
understanding of the main ideas behind Flutter app development. Flutterâ€™s react-style framework means it observes when the state of a widget changes and then compares it to the previous state to determine the least number of changes to make. Flutter manages the
relationship between the state and the UI and rebuilds only those widgets when the state changes.
In this section, I also learn how to implement each class and most importantly which one to use depending on the requirement. Creating a hello world app is an excellent introduction to programming fundamentals. By understanding key concepts, following step by step processes, and exploring example code snippets, you'll establish a solid foundation for development.
